# Intro
AMaze Runner is a puzzle game where player needs to help main character Tricky to get back home. On the way, the user needs to avoid obstacles and Mike Wazowskis. There are a lot of them, so make sure to think of a strategy before you get moving! Don't worry though, if you are stuck, simply press the restart button and a new puzzle will be given to you. At the end of the day, this game is suppose to be fun. It is okay if you are not able to complete a certain level, because even myself as the creator fails to complete some of these levels. Take your time, but please get Tricky home though. His mom is really worried!
